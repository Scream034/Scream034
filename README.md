# About Me

I am a 16-year-old student and a junior developer with over 2 years of experience in the indie game and web development industries. While I don't have any major achievements yet, I've had the opportunity to work in a team of game developers through freelance work. I've received positive feedback for my work on parsing-related tasks on freelance platforms.
